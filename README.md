# True_False_face_ID

The project is an experimentation with data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ciplab/real-and-fake-face-detection with various methods.

pca_face_classification explores pca with SVG, random forests and knn, while the face_authenticator investigates CNN architectures,
through customed designed node-architecture, and tunning to pretrained models (ResNet50 and InceptionV3).
